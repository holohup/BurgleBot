Chapter 4

[4:1] Now the man knew his wife Eve, and she conceived and bore Cain, saying, "I have produced a man with the help of the LORD."
[4:2] Next she bore his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Cain a tiller of the ground.
[4:3] In the course of time Cain brought to the LORD an offering of the fruit of the ground,
[4:4] and Abel for his part brought of the firstlings of his flock, their fat portions. And the LORD had regard for Abel and his offering,
[4:5] but for Cain and his offering he had no regard. So Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.
[4:6] The LORD said to Cain, "Why are you angry, and why has your countenance fallen?
[4:7] If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is lurking at the door; its desire is for you, but you must master it."
[4:8] Cain said to his brother Abel, "Let us go out to the field." And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and killed him.
[4:9] Then the LORD said to Cain, "Where is your brother Abel?" He said, "I do not know; am I my brother's keeper?"
[4:10] And the LORD said, "What have you done? Listen; your brother's blood is crying out to me from the ground!
[4:11] And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.
[4:12] When you till the ground, it will no longer yield to you its strength; you will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth."
[4:13] Cain said to the LORD, "My punishment is greater than I can bear!
[4:14] Today you have driven me away from the soil, and I shall be hidden from your face; I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and anyone who meets me may kill me."
[4:15] Then the LORD said to him, "Not so! Whoever kills Cain will suffer a sevenfold vengeance." And the LORD put a mark on Cain, so that no one who came upon him would kill him.
[4:16] Then Cain went away from the presence of the LORD, and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
[4:17] Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch; and he built a city, and named it Enoch after his son Enoch.
[4:18] To Enoch was born Irad; and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael the father of Methushael, and Methushael the father of Lamech.
[4:19] Lamech took two wives; the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
[4:20] Adah bore Jabal; he was the ancestor of those who live in tents and have livestock.
[4:21] His brother's name was Jubal; he was the ancestor of all those who play the lyre and pipe.
[4:22] Zillah bore Tubal-cain, who made all kinds of bronze and iron tools. The sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.
[4:23] Lamech said to his wives: "Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; you wives of Lamech, listen to what I say: I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for striking me.
[4:24] If Cain is avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy-sevenfold."
[4:25] Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and named him Seth, for she said, "God has appointed for me another child instead of Abel, because Cain killed him."
[4:26] To Seth also a son was born, and he named him Enosh. At that time people began to invoke the name of the LORD.

Chapter 5

[5:1] This is the list of the descendants of Adam. When God created humankind, he made them in the likeness of God.
[5:2] Male and female he created them, and he blessed them and named them "Humankind" when they were created.
[5:3] When Adam had lived one hundred thirty years, he became the father of a son in his likeness, according to his image, and named him Seth.
[5:4] The days of Adam after he became the father of Seth were eight hundred years; and he had other sons and daughters.
[5:5] Thus all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred thirty years; and he died.
[5:6] When Seth had lived one hundred five years, he became the father of Enosh.
[5:7] Seth lived after the birth of Enosh eight hundred seven years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:8] Thus all the days of Seth were nine hundred twelve years; and he died.
[5:9] When Enosh had lived ninety years, he became the father of Kenan.
[5:10] Enosh lived after the birth of Kenan eight hundred fifteen years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:11] Thus all the days of Enosh were nine hundred five years; and he died.
[5:12] When Kenan had lived seventy years, he became the father of Mahalalel.
[5:13] Kenan lived after the birth of Mahalalel eight hundred and forty years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:14] Thus all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years; and he died.
[5:15] When Mahalalel had lived sixty-five years, he became the father of Jared.
[5:16] Mahalalel lived after the birth of Jared eight hundred thirty years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:17] Thus all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety-five years; and he died.
[5:18] When Jared had lived one hundred sixty-two years he became the father of Enoch.
[5:19] Jared lived after the birth of Enoch eight hundred years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:20] Thus all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty-two years; and he died.
[5:21] When Enoch had lived sixty-five years, he became the father of Methuselah.
[5:22] Enoch walked with God after the birth of Methuselah three hundred years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:23] Thus all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty-five years.
[5:24] Enoch walked with God; then he was no more, because God took him.
[5:25] When Methuselah had lived one hundred eighty-seven years, he became the father of Lamech.
[5:26] Methuselah lived after the birth of Lamech seven hundred eighty- two years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:27] Thus all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty-nine years; and he died.
[5:28] When Lamech had lived one hundred eighty-two years, he became the father of a son;
[5:29] he named him Noah, saying, "Out of the ground that the LORD has cursed this one shall bring us relief from our work and from the toil of our hands."
[5:30] Lamech lived after the birth of Noah five hundred ninety-five years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:31] Thus all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy-seven years; and he died.
[5:32] After Noah was five hundred years old, Noah became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
Chapter 11

[11:1] Now the whole earth had one language and the same words.
[11:2] And as they migrated from the east, they came upon a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there.
[11:3] And they said to one another, "Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly." And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar.
[11:4] Then they said, "Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves; otherwise we shall be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth."
[11:5] The LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which mortals had built.
[11:6] And the LORD said, "Look, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is only the beginning of what they will do; nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them.
[11:7] Come, let us go down, and confuse their language there, so that they will not understand one another's speech."
[11:8] So the LORD scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city.
[11:9] Therefore it was called Babel, because there the LORD confused the language of all the earth; and from there the LORD scattered them abroad over the face of all the earth.
[11:10] These are the descendants of Shem. When Shem was one hundred years old, he became the father of Arpachshad two years after the flood;
[11:11] and Shem lived after the birth of Arpachshad five hundred years, and had other sons and daughters.
[11:12] When Arpachshad had lived thirty-five years, he became the father of Shelah;
[11:13] and Arpachshad lived after the birth of Shelah four hundred three years, and had other sons and daughters.
[11:14] When Shelah had lived thirty years, he became the father of Eber;
[11:15] and Shelah lived after the birth of Eber four hundred three years, and had other sons and daughters.
[11:16] When Eber had lived thirty-four years, he became the father of Peleg;
[11:17] and Eber lived after the birth of Peleg four hundred thirty years, and had other sons and daughters.
[11:18] When Peleg had lived thirty years, he became the father of Reu;
[11:19] and Peleg lived after the birth of Reu two hundred nine years, and had other sons and daughters.
[11:20] When Reu had lived thirty-two years, he became the father of Serug;
[11:21] and Reu lived after the birth of Serug two hundred seven years, and had other sons and daughters.
[11:22] When Serug had lived thirty years, he became the father of Nahor;
[11:23] and Serug lived after the birth of Nahor two hundred years, and had other sons and daughters.
[11:24] When Nahor had lived twenty-nine years, he became the father of Terah;
[11:25] and Nahor lived after the birth of Terah one hundred nineteen years, and had other sons and daughters.
[11:26] When Terah had lived seventy years, he became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
[11:27] Now these are the descendants of Terah. Terah was the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran was the father of Lot.
[11:28] Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldeans.
[11:29] Abram and Nahor took wives; the name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife was Milcah. She was the daughter of Haran the father of Milcah and Iscah.
[11:30] Now Sarai was barren; she had no child.
[11:31] Terah took his son Abram and his grandson Lot son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai, his son Abram's wife, and they went out together from Ur of the Chaldeans to go into the land of Canaan; but when they came to Haran, they settled there.
[11:32] The days of Terah were two hundred five years; and Terah died in Haran.
